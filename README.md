# C# Functions
I created functional-programming-like functions in C#.

Functions can be partaily applyed, added, subtracted and compared.

I have also added a Chainer, which lets you chain functions togther, and a few other classes to help you work better with functions

This is the first library and code I publish and the first time I work with Github, and I hope I've done everything correctly.
